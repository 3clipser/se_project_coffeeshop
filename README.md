## Plan on improving the project

I really struggled with this one and had to refer to discord quite a few times so I am sure I made some mistakes especially in the about and footer. I may have some code that might be redundant without my knowledge despit that I really did try my hardest and took an entire day to work on this. I do like and dislike at the same time that the training wheels are coming off and now I am having to figure alot of this on my own. The biggest thing I need to work on is really understanding how the styling works and how if effects everything.
